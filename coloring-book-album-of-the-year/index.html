This is a very messy often disjointed work with a clear secondary-material quality. My Coloring Book is a song written by Fred Ebb and John KanderFirst performed by Sandy Stewart in 1962 on the television program The Perry Como Kraft Music Hall she was one of the first artists to record the work in 1962 when it was released as a singleShe also included the song on her 1963 album which was also named My Coloring Book. It almost runs like a Thom Yorke solo project song minus Thom Yorke of course and add in some 30 year old post-hardcore veterans on the quest for new territory. Im not coming for Beyoncé at all.</p>

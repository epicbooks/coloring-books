Today as I was walking In the fields just down the way I sat down on a fallen log To pass the time away And as I looked around me The more that I did look The more I realize that I am viewing Gods coloring book I saw a golden ray of sunlight A silver drop of dew A soft white floating cloud Sailing. The more that I did look. Gods coloring book The grayness in an old mans hair The pink in babys cheeks The blackness in a stormy sky The brown in fallen leaves And the multicolored rainbow Stretched out across the sky And the purple haze at sunset Just before the night And the more I look around me And the more that I do look The more I realize that I am viewing Gods coloring book.

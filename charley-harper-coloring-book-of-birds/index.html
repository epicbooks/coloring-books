<p>My only complaint &ndash; the paper is thin so if you use markers or paint &ndash; the kinds of things that give you the rich color his images call out for &ndash;. Would make a lovely gift for a young child. This is a lovely coloring book. Each bird is meticulously hand-carved and hand-crafted. In this lovely coloring book young artists can create their own colorful originals using American illustrator Charley Harpers black and white line drawings of birds and other animals.
